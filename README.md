# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Description
This is a command line application that generates a team profile from a users input using the Inquirer Package.

## Function

This team profile generator functions by opening your integrated terminal. Type node index.js in your terminal, when the application runs it then presents a series of questions to the user. When done your responses will be saved in the team.html file.

## Credits

I would like to give credit to my Varsity Tutor for taking the time to help me understand how to use the terminal and vsCode to build this team profile generator.
